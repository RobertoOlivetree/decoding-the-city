Data Science and AI approaches to analyze and explain urban accessibility patterns in Porto.

# Decoding the City: Data Science and AI for Understanding Urban Accessibility

## Overview

**Decoding the City** is a research-oriented project that applies **Data Science** and **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** to analyze and explain **urban accessibility** in the city of **Porto, Portugal**.  
Through **geospatial analysis**, **clustering**, and **Explainable AI (XAI)**, the project studies how different population groups ‚Äî particularly the elderly ‚Äî access essential services such as healthcare, education, commerce, and transportation.

The goal is to generate insights that support **inclusive urban planning**, **mobility equity**, and **data-driven decision-making** for more sustainable and human-centered cities.

## Motivation

Accessibility is one of the core aspects of urban equity and social inclusion.  
By integrating open data and AI, this project aims to:

- Identify **patterns of inequality in urban accessibility** across Porto‚Äôs parishes.  
- Apply **machine learning and clustering** to classify areas based on service proximity.  
- Use **explainable AI methods** to understand *why* certain areas show better or worse accessibility.

## üìÅ File Descriptions

### **Data Files (`/data/`)**

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **average_distance_to_services.csv** | Contains the average distance from each parish to various categories of essential services (e.g., hospitals, schools, markets). This serves as the main accessibility metric. |
| **population_65_plus.csv** | Demographic data showing the proportion of residents aged 65 and older per parish, used to analyze accessibility for vulnerable populations. |
| **porto_parishes.csv** | Geospatial data defining the administrative boundaries of Porto‚Äôs parishes. Enables mapping and spatial visualization of results. |
| **services_by_category.csv** | List of categorized services (e.g., Health, Education, Commerce) with geographic coordinates, used to compute service density and proximity. |

### **Supporting Files**

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **requirements.txt** | Lists Python dependencies needed to reproduce the environment. |
| **.gitignore** | Defines which files and folders are ignored by Git (temporary data, virtual environments, caches, etc.). |
| **src/** | Optional folder for helper scripts or reusable Python modules. |
| **docs/** | Folder for generated reports, charts, and exported figures. |

## Objectives

- Measure **urban accessibility** and service proximity across Porto.  
- Detect **spatial patterns** using clustering algorithms.  
- Apply **Explainable AI** to interpret model behavior and key drivers.  
- Support **inclusive and evidence-based urban planning**.
